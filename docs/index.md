## Domain

**Use Case:**  
Domains help logically group systems and components that share a broader business or technical context. This makes it easier to navigate large catalogs, assign high-level ownership, and establish boundaries for governance and architecture.

---

## System

**Use Case:**  
Systems represent a full product or business function composed of multiple components and resources. Use systems to encapsulate and manage everything involved in delivering a feature or platform capability.

---

## Component

**Use Case:**  
Components are the core building blocks of software systems—services, libraries, websites, etc. Use them to track ownership, documentation, and dependencies for each deployable or reusable unit of code.

---

## API

**Use Case:**  
APIs define communication contracts between systems and components. They help clarify integration points, facilitate service discovery, and maintain consistent documentation for consumers.

---

## Resource

**Use Case:**  
Resources model infrastructure dependencies such as databases, queues, and storage. This supports better operational awareness, dependency mapping, and incident response planning.
